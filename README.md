# 🎄 Advent of Code 2024 – OCaml Solutions

Welcome to my **Advent of Code 2024** repository!  
This project contains my daily solutions written in **OCaml**, with each day's puzzle separated into two parts and organized in a clean, modular structure.

---

## 📁 Project Structure

Each day's folder is named after the day number (`1` to `25`). Inside each folder:

- `solve_1.ml` – solution to **Part 1**
- `solve_2.ml` – solution to **Part 2**
- `input` – create it with your input (AOC's author [Eric Wastl](https://was.tl/) suggests not publishing puzzle inputs)
- `dune` – Dune file to build the solutions


---

## 🚀 How to Run

To run a solution, make sure you have [OCaml](https://ocaml.org/) installed.

Then:

```bash
  dune build
```
To execute solution

```bash
  (cat <day_number>/input | dune exec ./<day_number>/solve_<part_number>.exe)
```
replace `<day_number>` with the folder name, e.g 1

replace `<part_number>` with 1 for Part 1 or 2 for Part 2
